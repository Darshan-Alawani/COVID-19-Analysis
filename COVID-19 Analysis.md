This Portfolio Project focuses on the COVID-19 Dataset that was obtained from the link: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

This dataset contains COVID-19-related data from January 01, 2020, till August 02, 2023. It has various columns such as new_cases, new_deaths, new_vaccinations, etc.

This dataset was downloaded as a CSV file. Upon opening the dataset in Microsoft Excel, 2 separate tables namely - COVID_Deaths & COVID_Vaccinations were created and saved as separate Excel Workbooks.

The 2 tables were then uploaded into MS SQL Server for data cleaning and Exploratory Data analysis (EDA), using SQL operations like CTE, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types, and Joins.

Once the EDA part was completed, a few queries were executed to generate tables needed to create Tableau visualisations.

Once the datasets were saved and uploaded to Tableau, visualizations were then created to show a clearer picture of the analysis. Finally, the individual sheets were then added together to create a dashboard. The final visualization can be viewed here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/darshan.alawani/viz/COVID-19Dashboard_16920141690690/Dashboard1?publish=yes
